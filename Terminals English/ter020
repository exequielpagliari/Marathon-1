;L020.AMS.ENTRY#logonPublic Access Terminal 4-a<892.33.12.479>#information***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***The Marathon's Automatic Manufacturing Systems have finished making replacement circuits.  There are three circuits; each should be in its manufacturing holding chamber. With luck, the alien viruses have not infiltrated the Manufacturing Systems, but even if they had, I would have no way of knowing.  The attacks on my systems are growing more steady.  If the counterattack is not able to remove some of the computer infiltrators, then I will eventually succumb.  It is absolutely imperative that a counterattack begin as soon as possible.  The Marathon is not defenseless, and we can't let it be taken without a fight.***END MESSAGE***#checkpoint 0This is where the circuits should be.  Look in all of the receptacle lockers.#checkpoint 2There is a pattern buffer located next to your current location.  I suggest that you use it immediately.#checkpoint 6After you have retrieved the circuits, return to the terminal at this location, and I will transport you to the Defense Center to install them.
