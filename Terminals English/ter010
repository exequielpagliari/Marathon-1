;L010.BIGGUNS.ENTRY#logonLevel 29-b Section 10 Public Access Terminal<102.21.521.146>#information***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***I am now in contact with a number of colonists planetside, but their reports on the situation below are conflicting and obviously exaggerated.  The primary medium-range radio antenna has been disabled or destroyed, which makes communication extremely difficult.The only thing which seems clear is that the spaceport was obliterated by low-yield nuclear weapons minutes after the attack on the Marathon began.  This I can verify through my own optical instruments.The invaders seem to be more interested in the Marathon than the colony, at least in the short term.  The motives behind their unprovoked attack are still unknown, however.#checkpoint 0This is the computer terminal you are using now.  I cannot teleport you out of this section from here, so you will have to leave from another terminal after you find the assault rifle.#checkpoint 1There is an M-75 Assault Rifle/Grenade Launcher and ammunition at this location.  When firing on the fully automatic setting this weapon is highly inaccurate, but the grenades hit hard and it's the best we can do right now.  Ammunition may be scarce for a while, so be prepared to fall back to your pistol.#checkpoint 2Here is the terminal you must reach to leave this section.  Alien infiltration of this area is high; proceed with caution.  You may find doors blocked or stairways retracted on the way, because the AI in control of these functions is damaged and behaving erratically.***END OF MESSAGE***
