;L019.BIGGUNS.EXIT#logonPublic Access Terminal <101.532.74.95>#briefing 2***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***The Marathon's automated defenses were disabled during the initial attack by a directed magnetic pulse.  The aliens used the same weapon to disable the Marathon's other two AIs, Durandal and Tycho, and to severely damage myself.Durandal is responsible for controlling the ship's autonomous functions: doors, life support, kitchens, air reprocessors, stairs, and so on.  Because he is non-functional, I am working to assume as many of these tasks as possible.  Tycho controls the science and engineering network.Now that you are better armed, our first priority is to reactivate the Marathon's defenses, under my control, so that we may offer some resistance to the aliens.  I have built three replacement circuit boards for the defense system, but cannot move them from the manufacturing center without assistance.I will now transport you to retrieve the replacement parts, and will give you further instructions when you arrive.***END OF MESSAGE***$B***JUMP PAD ACTIVATION INITIATION START***$B***TRANSPORT WHEN READY***
