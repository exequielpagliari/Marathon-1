;L009.WELCOME.EXIT#logonHangar Area 5 Teleporter Pad Terminal<93.53.211.53>#briefing 1***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***All of the information that I have gathered so far indicates that the Alien invasion of the Marathon has been relatively uncoordinated.  I suspect that this is partially due to the Marathon's large size. However disorderly the Alien invasion is, their assault of the Computer Net has been extremely effective.  I detect security breaches in almost every computer system onboard the Marathon; I have learned that there is an Alien creature that is capable of interfacing with our systems.You must kill any of these creatures that you find.  It is a priority that we stop them.  Even now, they are penetrating my defenses. Teleport now.***End Message***$B***JUMP PAD ACTIVATION INITIATION START***$B***TRANSPORT WHEN READY***
