Terminal Editing

When terminals are placed, you use the script pop-up menu to indicate the terminal’s ID number. 
This should always start with zero, not one and corresponds to a specific piece of text contained 
within a text file. When merged, this text file is placed within the map file and the terminal 
becomes usable. See Tutorial 8 for more on merging maps.

The text file can be generated using any text editor such as SimpleText will do nicely. The PICT 
resources are contained in a Terminal PICTs document that you create using ResEdit, available at 
Apple's web site, www.apple.com. Here is a list of the terminal text commands you can use:

The ";" is used to mark comments.
#TERMINAL n starts terminal n, where n is the terminal’s ID number. This should always start 
with zero as should the scripts for the terminals in the level.

#LOGON n will display a PICT with resource n. This PICT will fill most of the screen with a small 
amount of room at the bottom for text.

#UNFINISHED indicates the commands to display if level goal has not been completed.

#FINISHED indicates the commands that will be displayed when the level goal has been completed.

#INFORMATION will display a page without any graphics, only the text and commands you indicate.

#PICT n will display a screen with a PICT with resource n. The PICT will be displayed on one half 
of the screen and the text you indicate will be displayed on the other half.

#CHECKPOINT n will display on one half of the screen a picture of the overhead map with object 
goal n (as opposed to the polygon goal) circled. Text will be displayed on the other half of the 
terminal screen.

#INTERLEVEL TELEPORT n teleports the marine to level n. Setting n to 256 will end the game and 
return the player Marathon's main menu screen.

#INTRALEVEL TELEPORT n teleports marine to polygon n.

#LOGOFF n works just like logon but displayed when logging off the terminal.

#END ends finished or unfinished section of text.

#ENDTERMINAL n ends terminal n.

The text commands are:

$Cn changes colors of text to color n, where n can be any number between 0 and 7. The following 
colors correspond to the numbers:

0 – light green
1 – white
2 – red
3 – dark green
4 – light blue
5 – yellow
6 – dark red
7 – dark blue

$B starts bold text. $b ends bold text.
$I begins italicized text. $i ends italics.
$U starts underlined text. $u ends underline.

So a typical terminal text would be as follows:

#TERMINAL 0
;sample terminal
#UNFINISHED
#LOGON 1600
#PICT 10000
$C6You must kill $B$Ieverything$i$b you find and not return until your
deed is done$c6
#LOGOFF 1601
#END
#FINISHED
#LOGON 1600
#PICT 10001
Good work. Onward we go.
#LOGOFF 1601
#INTERLEVEL TELEPORT 01
#END
#ENDTERMINAL 0

Probably the best way to learn terminal text editing is to get the Marathon Map Splitter and check 
out the terminals that were made by Bungie by splitting the Infinity Map file. You will need 
ResEdit to view the PICT resources and any text editor, such as SimpleText to view the actual 
terminal commands.
